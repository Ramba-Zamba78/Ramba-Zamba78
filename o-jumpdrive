    description "Nobody knows the origin of the mythical Warp Drive, more commonly known as the Red Jump Drive. After their first falures trying to figure out a normal jump drive, USC engineers upgrate it. It make longer jumps than a red jump drive, and seems to have a built in ramscoop array. It can also navigate unstable wormholes due to what appears to be a glowing red keystone. The space under the jumpdrive was used some different, so outfit space and mass reduction is lower. The gaslining feature is lost and there is a more need of jump fuel to +50%. But for this the jumprange comes now to 300uu!"
