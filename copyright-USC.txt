Comment: After a full year of searching for Exodus i gave up and decide to cheat, because the % of find all three component-ships were to low. i never got all three parts in one game i startet! That sucks! Meanwhile i upgrated a deathharmonica to unsiegeable and found out how the wanderer story goes to the point they travel to korath space...as is the game as heavy because the different language (and my miserable englich), i was unbelieving the Exodus is that unstrong :( 
After a short while i decide to program a new system, but i have had to many nice names as they all would get into only one system. So i tried out to combine it to the Mod-system within a wormhole. This works, but the Mod-system is not my only own. So i create a second for export and to close the wormhole.
i wrote more than 70 Missions, most work fine. I am not intelligent enoug to fix all problems i cause, sry, so some things doesn't work right.

My error was to wan't to do to much for all the other players, i believe. At the end, my Linux wont start the Game any longer! I deinstall it, look if all components are gone, then installed it new, but the srarter won't load the game =(
Now i hope someone on github may fortune my work of a new USC World behind a wormhole in different space with many large asteroid fields for mining with random payloads. i have had much fun at it. :)
Two different starts were created, the bank picture never worked. i create an orange jump drive with my own pictures, but i have no sounds for it, sry.
The png pictures i shot myself, cut them and pressed them into png mode on right size. They looks great.
Maybe in some weeks i can play again..so long have fun with my uploaded dates...
