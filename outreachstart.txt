	` ...after weeks of injureness - your wounds are nearly all healed - you begin to walk again and train all other muskular cells of your body. Your Rescuers are nice and human, but won't you give more information as usually need. "You are secure here, concentrate on healing, you have time enough.." After 3 months you are visited by an gouverneurs Attendant, who is given you your different Pilot's License back and disclaim, that your ship was disabled to much, to get repaired. "We decide to buy your wreck for science, our offer is 1.500.000cr and a warmly welcome yours to our Space. There is also no need to pay for an Mining-Allowness for you, too. Save Travels..." you walk to the Bank, he has told you. The bank is a garden building near the green center of town. Inside, your loan officer, a joung woman, introduces you to the bank direktor, her father. He welcomes you and excuses the building with the words: "normally, we don't make bank transfers at weekend.." and show you, where to sign. During a pause between the fifth and sixt beer, he lals, "..next two weeks we're on holiday trip. Better sign today, right?!" `
	`	"We have heard about your accident in our space at news. You are at 1.500.000 cr now." he says, "1.000.000cr to be repaid over the course of one year. Thanks to our gouverneur of trade and external affairs! Your daily interest rate are very fair 0.002%, beer isn't that expencive, but you pay the next garden party. Sign here." He is laughing loud. You know he is linking you, but maybe its your only chan ce to get you ass is space again?!`
	`	You sign your name one final time:`
	name
	`	The wind hits your face as you leave torkling the improvised bank office. Despite the cold, you are smiling. This crazy adventure suddenly feels warmly nice to you. You are going to do it. You are finally going to get off this planet for first time since your accident.`
	`	Compared to the bank, you feel also excited in the shipyard, walking among the rusted out shuttles and newer small ships that gleam in the sunlight. You smell grease and dirt and bit wet ionised atmosphere; wonderful smells. There are some ship models within your price range, but no fighting ships. Lets hope this galaxy is as peaceful as you believe it...`
